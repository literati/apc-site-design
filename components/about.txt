The collaborative project Poe’s Republic of Letters will juxtapose the author’s poetry and tales against a rich array of period texts, images, and maps to demonstrate the feasibility of an interdisciplinary reconstruction of U.S. antebellum print culture. We aim to illuminate Poe’s thorny relationship to Jacksonian America and cultural nation-building. We will produce a robust account of Poe’s resistance to literary nationalism, popular democracy, and material culture by explaining the connections between his strange texts and the events, problems, and controversies that troubled his creative imagination. We will connect textual and visual materials to the literature, producing a more informed understanding of both the works Poe produced and the cultural space he inhabited. The project will thus test a model for the multi-author digital research center we will construct with partner institutions to document the dynamic interplay between American literature and antebellum culture.
